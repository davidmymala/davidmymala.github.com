        <p id = "para2">Family has played a huge role in my growth as a person. In the picture to the top, I finally finished transferring to UC Davis after transferring out of community college one year after high school. This endeavor was encouraged by my sister who suggested I should take college classes in high school. Regarding external factors, I have listed some of my favorite books down below that have shaped my mindset.</p>
