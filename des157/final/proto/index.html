            <h3>Design & Code Articulation</h3>
            <p id = "questions1">In what ways has your design for your final project evolved from what you created for the studio (if any)?</p>
            <p>My original mad libs project was pretty stagnant. Some ways I have thought about changing my final project is through the use of color and how to use that effectively. I will include overlays as well to improve the interaction rather than recreating my original project. Overall, I have thought about different ways my project can showcase a madlib.</p>
            <p id = "questions2">In what ways is the functionality or interaction design for your planned final project significantly improved from your studio project (if any)?</p>
            <p>The functionality of my design for my final project has improved because I have added audio indications, overlays, and generally better visual hierarchy.</p>
            <p id = "questions3">How far along are you with the development of your project, and how much more do you need to do to complete it?</p>
            <p>I am not that far in my development of my project. What I have in this prototype are elements that I want to have in my project for now. So I would say this is only about like 10% of my project.</p>
            <p id = "questions4">Is there anything in your project that you are concerned about being able to produce?</p>
            <p>I might have some trouble with the type writer effect.</p>
