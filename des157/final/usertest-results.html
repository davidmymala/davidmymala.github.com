    <h1>User Test Results and Feedback</h1>

        <h2>Music Player for Different Screen Sizes.</h2>
        <p>First observation that I noticed was that while testing people experienced varying sizes for the music player. This caused some people to not notice the music player, or the music player would lie on top near the bottom of my food selections. For the problem of not being able to notice the music player while looking at the website, I could perhaps increase the padding of my music player or add an auto play attribute. For the varying sizes of my music player on different screens, I will need to adjust some of the percentages or mess around with some of the viewport specifications.</p>

        <h2>Colors</h2>
        <p>The second observation that I noticed was the colors of my overlays which came up a lot in my user feedback. The color that was mentioned the most was my yellow overlay, which did not work well with the white text. Some suggestions were to change the colors or at least turn down the saturation amongst them. More suggestions included perhaps making my background dark when these overlays are clicked on as there could be an information overload with the number of colors present when clicking one of the buttons. I could also possibly reduce the opacity of the overlays themselves. Overall, I will determine what colors work best with my color scheme and background for my overlays.  </p>

        <h2>Design and General Experience</h2>
        <p>The third observation that I noticed was that people generally liked my designs. Alongside that the music and button interactions aided in creating a pleasant user experience. To improve on such designs, I can add more animations, maybe to my sun in the top left corner. While user testing the website, people thought the image would do something, as everything in my website pretty much had an interactive function. I am thinking about putting adjusting the CSS to either rotate or increase the width of the object automatically. Speaking more about the designs, I plan to have my overlays come from left to right which can be done using the slide-in function in CSS. I also want to create an animation for my images to appear from the bottom to the top as this can create more of an experience.</p>
