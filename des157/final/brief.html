    <h1>Project Brief</h1>

    <article>
        <h2>Project Summary</h2>
        <p>For my final project, I want to improve my Mad Libs project to create a more interactive experience as well as add more css animations. </p>

        <h2>Comparison Project 1</h2>
        <h3><a href = "https://evrone.com/crypton-layout">Crypton Layout</a></h3>
        <p>I found this website by searching up some cool websites on google. I was interested at first in this website because I was interested in the topic the website was covering. However, when I reviewed the website, I loved how they created their designs and interactions.  The typewriter effect gave me some ideas for what I can include in my website. On the bottom left, there are these navigation links that take you to different sequences of the page. I can probably incorporate this into transitioning my forms.</p>
        <p>As far as the website itself, the interface design is sleek. The color scheme allows the highlighting of objects on the page. Regarding interaction, the website played a lot with the y-scroll and automated animations to introduce new topics or transition to them. The design stays clear of not overloading information by putting things like the sharable social media hidden under the share link. I also like their contacts tab in which content is separated by the different shades of gray. The only thing possibly I would change would be adding a little more color to balance because on one screen it uses blue/purple arbitrarily. Overall, I had a great experience viewing this website.</p>

        <h2>Comparison Project 2</h2>
        <h3><a href = "https://groupe.castoretpollux.com/">Groupe Castoret & Pollux</a></h3>
        <p>This website is also something that shares my intentions in what I want to create in my mad libs project. This website helped me think of new ideas regarding using forms. This website uses a unique selection by clicking on the different buttons to transition to new content. </p>
        <p>The website itself is colorful and is pleasing to look at. The interaction design is very fun because of the y-scroll and transitions. For example, when hovering over elements it plays a little sound to let the user know that there are these clickable objects. The interface design is interesting, something I would possibly change about it is allowing the navigation links to the right to be able to disappear as you scroll. The interface seems perfect on that first screen that you land on, however when you scroll the content on the other screens seems bloated. Overall, the experience was great, and this brought me new ideas I can create for my final project.</p>

        <h2>Project Goals</h2>
        <p>My project goals include being able to create a fun experience with my mad libs. I was kind of stuck on what to do with my project because I was not thinking about what more I can do with the form regarding input and submission. However, after looking at these two projects, I now know I want to add a combination of both elements present from these projects. I would say my intentions are most like Groupe Castor & Pollux’s project. The color scheme and interactions of the buttons are what struck out. In my case, I will treat those buttons that you can click on my form, as users can select from a variety of selections that I offer. I want to offer an experience while navigating my website. The other project is a little different from what I intend, but I was intrigued by the use of animations and transitions. As I mentioned before, the typewriting animation is similar to my intentions on what animated content I can have as far as design. </p>

        <h2>Design Strategies</h2>
        <p>For the look of the website, I want to make it colorful kind of like the different colors of foods that are available. For the feel, I want to create a similar feeling to what I have seen on Groupe Castor & Pollux’s website. The website encouraged exploration and interaction using color, transitions, and sound. Regarding the type, I want to lean towards more fonts that would suit subheadings to draw attention to the various links/navigations. For visual hierarchy, I aim to create my content to be displayed horizontally but I am also comfortable with making my project a vertical format.</p>

        <h2>Interaction Strategies</h2>
        <p>I plan on creating an automatic CSS animation to create a typewriter effect. This typewriter effect would probably be under my title as my subheading. Also, I might incorporate the effect into my content that appears to make new content delayed. I plan to implement sound on hover objects and make use of the hover focus. By using the hover focus, I could probably make the colors relate to the content of what food will be showing. Regarding inputs, I may incorporate that within my transitions otherwise they would be limited to the user clicking on a set of options to navigate the website.</p>

        <h2>Experience Goals</h2>
        <p>My intended experience for the audience is to make the project appealing in color and interactivity.  The interaction strategies I mentioned will help set a mood/tone to help navigate my content. The use of color will also play an effect on what mood my website brings. I also intend to create unique graphics to further personalize my website. Exploration will be a key component that I will focus on my website because I want the user to explore among the various options to be selected from. I thought my original mad lib was stagnant, so by adding the elements I mentioned I hope to create a fun experience for the user.</p>
