            <p>This article on modals allowed me to understand their usage on a website. The article referred to modals as a version of the dreaded pop-up window. Immediately reading this, I thought about how it can possibly be integrated into my Mad Libs while thinking of a submit button transition.</p>
            <p>Their usage focuses on grabbing the userâ€™s attention, getting user input, and showing additional information in context and not in context. One helpful tip was the article showing the look of the anatomy and design of a modal window which made me rethink how I might be able to use this. We received real examples of modals like composing a tweet and we see that the background is darkened with the focus being the modal window itself.</p>
            <p>There were some flaws regarding mobile and accessibility which was good to know about the mobile UI practices. Overall, from what I have read, I think that modals have a special use case to them, but I also feel that they take a lot away from content if used incorrectly.</p>

            <p>The article taught me design principles when creating forms on a webpage. This will be very useful when we are starting to code our Mad Lib projects. Many design changes may seem small, but they can have a huge impact on the user experience when filling out a form.</p>
            <p>One tip I thought was useful was making input fields smaller or larger according to the content. The zip code input being smaller in proportion is a lot more clear to the viewer and will not visually trick anyone. I understood this as if people see extra space, then they may write more than needed.</p>
            <p>From this article, I also learned what not to do when creating a form like having asterisks on option fields and not using placeholder text. I found this article useful because it allowed me to understand what might confuse a user and taught me how to prevent these issues.</p>
