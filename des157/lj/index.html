            <p>The article taught me design principles when creating forms on a webpage. This will be very useful when we are starting to code our Mad Lib projects. Many design changes may seem small, but they can have a huge impact on the user experience when filling out a form.</p>
            <p>One tip I thought was useful was making input fields smaller or larger according to the content. The zip code input being smaller in proportion is a lot more clear to the viewer and will not visually trick anyone. I understood this as if people see extra space, then they may write more than needed.</p>
            <p>From this article, I also learned what not to do when creating a form like having asterisks on option fields and not using placeholder text. I found this article useful because it allowed me to understand what might confuse a user and taught me how to prevent these issues.</p>
