            <p>In this article, Amir Dori showcases his knowledge regarding some good user experience game design practices among having 10 years of experience in the industry. Amir mentions that game designers take advantage of data through playtesting, usability, and data to create the best playing experience for the user/player.</p>

            <p>One of the things that Amir mentions is the UI positions in mobile devices which I found interesting. He knows that most users are right-handed, so he capitalizes on the comfort-to-reach areas. From what I can gather from this is to know who your users are and what their habits are.</p>

            <p>Most of the elements mentioned pertain to mobile game design but can also be implemented in projects like our Game On! project that we are about to create. Elements that I would consider for my projects are the user choices (pop-ups), and possibly sliders; I think these two are great interactive elements that I may incorporate in my game. Potentially I would use pop-ups to announce the winner. Regarding the sliders, I think they would be useful in creating a game setting that is representative of a casino while the dice randomizes.</p>

            <h3>Every Picture Part 1</h2>
            <figure>
                <img id = "babypic" src = "images/David Mymala babypic.jpg" alt = "babypic">
                <figcaption>David Mymala, Childhood Photo (2021)</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>This image is interesting because it represents the beginning of my story (life). What this picture shows is a photo of my siblings and me smiling as kids. Also, I feel like this picture gives a sense of joy or happiness. Instead of this being solely focused on me, I thought it was appropriate to have a picture with my siblings because I consider them to have inspired me to become who I am today. I will use this picture as the basis to branch out my story. </p>

            <p>The concept of my project is about who I am and what I have been inspired by. You can probably tell that this image is a bit older and this will contrast to the newer photos I will be using in my project.   </p>

            <p>My archive helps tell a story about me by showing how I have grown as a person and it shows moments in my life that I feel are inspiring. All the images used in my project will help explain the narrative of the moments of my life that have led me to who I am today. </p>
            <h3>Every Picture Part 2</h2>
            <figure>
                <img id = "plushie" src = "images/plushie.jpeg" alt = "plushie">
                <figcaption>Peter Lin, Corgi Plush (2021)</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>This is a photo of a corgi plushie and it is part of Peter’s collection of plushies. I believe that this plushie and each plushie he collects represents a certain moment that he can reminisce on. I think Peter’s theme is about the recollection of memories, which is similar to what I am trying to accomplish in my project.</p>

            <p>Looking at this from an outsider’s view, this corgi plushie does not provide much meaning to me. However, some things I can comment on are that I thought the plushie looked brand new and it gave me the sense of being playful. The expression on the corgi plushie demonstrates the playfulness, as well as its use of bright colors.</p>

            <p>The most obvious part about this image is that it is a stuffed animal. The mysterious aspect about this image is knowing what the plushie truly means to Peter. Another mysterious aspect was knowing where this image will lead me regarding transitioning to the other photos in his project.</p>

            <p>I picked the Memory Cloud website to do my Reading Journal because the imagery and font style first caught my eye. The usage of images had these leaves falling as you first open the page, and when everything is rendered some leaves stay suspended in mid-air while some leaves lay towards the bottom of the page.</p>

            <p>The way this site plays with interaction lies within the use of perspective that changes when you have your mouse hovering parts of the screen. When clicking on other links on the page, the leaves animate, almost like they are guiding you towards the different sections. At times, I can feel distracted from the content due to the immense amount of animation. </p>

            <p>This website sticks with a theme and focuses on creating a unique experience for the user. There is even a music player at the bottom right corner that keeps the same vibe as the image representation. I loved how on the explore page, the leaves were tied to a person's name. </p>

            <p> A couple of suggestions I had for this website, was that as I kept exploring, I found myself lost at times especially when you can infinitely scroll with the leaves moving in the background. There are also times, the animations and effects overburden the website causing it to become laggy. Overall, this website provides a unique experience with its concept of leaves representing memories.</p>

            <p>This article on modals allowed me to understand their usage on a website. The article referred to modals as a version of the dreaded pop-up window. Immediately reading this, I thought about how it can possibly be integrated into my Mad Libs while thinking of a submit button transition.</p>
            <p>Their usage focuses on grabbing the user’s attention, getting user input, and showing additional information in context and not in context. One helpful tip was the article showing the look of the anatomy and design of a modal window which made me rethink how I might be able to use this. We received real examples of modals like composing a tweet and we see that the background is darkened with the focus being the modal window itself.</p>
            <p>There were some flaws regarding mobile and accessibility which was good to know about the mobile UI practices. Overall, from what I have read, I think that modals have a special use case to them, but I also feel that they take a lot away from content if used incorrectly.</p>

            <h2><a href = "https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">Best practices for form design reflection (#1)</a></h2>
            <p>The article taught me design principles when creating forms on a webpage. This will be very useful when we are starting to code our Mad Lib projects. Many design changes may seem small, but they can have a huge impact on the user experience when filling out a form.</p>
            <p>One tip I thought was useful was making input fields smaller or larger according to the content. The zip code input being smaller in proportion is a lot more clear to the viewer and will not visually trick anyone. I understood this as if people see extra space, then they may write more than needed.</p>
            <p>From this article, I also learned what not to do when creating a form like having asterisks on option fields and not using placeholder text. I found this article useful because it allowed me to understand what might confuse a user and taught me how to prevent these issues.</p>
